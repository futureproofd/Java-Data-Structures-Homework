# JavaHomework
refresher exercises on Data Structures and Algorithms.

An important concept for first/last instance variables is that they are reference pointers to Node objects.

##### Big O notation:

![Example](https://github.com/futureproofd/JavaHomework/blob/master/assets/screencaps/big_o_notation.png)

A constant is a straight, horizontal line (same number of steps) per input: O(1)

A linear algorithm increases the number of steps to the input consistently, linearly relative to the size of the input: O(n) - a single loop

A quadratic algorithm increases steeply, requiring a higher number of steps per input: O(n2) - or a nested loop

##### Logarithmic scaling:

![Example](https://github.com/futureproofd/JavaHomework/blob/master/assets/screencaps/logarithmic.png)

A Logarithmic algorithm, O(log n) is faster than the previous algorithms, since we are dividing the input size (the inverse of exponentiation)
